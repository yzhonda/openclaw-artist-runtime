# Error and Reason Catalog

Artist Runtime uses short reason codes so operators can trace a fail-closed
decision back to the source subsystem without exposing credentials or raw
platform responses.

## Runbook anchors

These headings exist so Producer Console reason-code links can deep-link into
the catalog without relying on table-row rendering.

## Social distribution

| Code | Source | Meaning | Operator recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `requires_explicit_live_go` | X / Instagram connectors | A non-dry-run publish reached the connector edge, but live social publishing is still blocked. | Confirm the platform-specific live GO has been granted before changing connector policy. |
| `dry-run blocks publish` | X / Instagram connectors | Dry-run staging succeeded or was blocked before live publish. | Expected in setup-safe mode; inspect `effectiveDryRun` in `/api/status`. |
| `dry-run blocks social publish` | `socialPublishing` authority guard | Upstream policy kept the request in dry-run, so the connector was not called. | Check `autopilot.dryRun`, `distribution.enabled`, global `liveGoArmed`, and the target platform arm. |
| `bird_cli_not_installed` | X / Bird connector | The `bird` CLI was not found. | Install/configure Bird on the operator machine and rerun the X platform probe. |
| `bird_auth_expired` | X / Bird connector | Bird reported an expired or invalid X session. | Refresh the Bird cookie/token store using `docs/CONNECTOR_AUTH.md`. |
| `bird_probe_failed` | X / Bird connector | Bird was present, but account probing failed for a non-auth-specific reason. | Run the Bird CLI manually in the operator shell and inspect its local output. |
| `bird_rate_limited` | X / Bird connector | Bird surfaced X rate-limit or temporary lock signals. | Wait for the platform window to clear; do not retry in a tight loop. |
| `bird_compose_failed` | X / Bird connector | The dry-run compose stage failed before submit preview. | Inspect the post text and Bird CLI output in the local operator shell. |
| `bird_dry_run_submit_failed` | X / Bird connector | The dry-run submit preview failed. | Treat this as a fail-closed staging failure; rerun the X probe before live GO. |
| `instagram_auth_not_configured` | Instagram connector | No accepted Instagram token env var is set. | Set `OPENCLAW_INSTAGRAM_AUTH` or `OPENCLAW_INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN`, then reload the gateway shell. |
| `instagram_media_invalid` | Instagram connector | The requested media path list contains an empty value. | Regenerate or review the social asset payload before staging publish. |
| `instagram_business_account_not_found` | Instagram connector | Graph `/me/accounts` returned no page with an Instagram business account. | Link the Instagram account to a Facebook Page and confirm required scopes. |
| `instagram_graph_accounts_failed_401` | Instagram connector | Graph account lookup rejected the token as unauthorized. | Refresh the Instagram token and confirm `pages_show_list` scope. |
| `instagram_graph_accounts_failed_403` | Instagram connector | Graph account lookup was forbidden. | Check business/Page permissions and app review status. |
| `instagram_graph_accounts_failed_429` | Instagram connector | Graph account lookup was rate limited. | Pause retries and wait for the rate window. |
| `instagram_graph_media_failed_429` | Instagram connector | Media container creation was rate limited. | Pause publish staging and retry after the rate window. |
| `instagram_graph_publish_failed_500` | Instagram connector | Publish-stage Graph API returned a server error. | Keep the request fail-closed and retry only after Graph health recovers. |
| `tiktok_account_not_created` | TikTok connector | TikTok is intentionally frozen because the account lane is not created. | Do not configure TikTok until the operator explicitly opens that lane. |

## Suno and budget

| Code | Source | Meaning | Operator recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `budget_exhausted` | `SunoBudgetTracker` | The UTC-day Suno credit counter would exceed `dailyCreditLimit`. | Wait for UTC reset, adjust the config limit, or use the confirmed reset action. |
| `budget_exhausted_monthly` | `SunoBudgetTracker` | The optional monthly Suno counter would exceed `monthlyCreditLimit`. | Raise or disable the monthly limit only after reviewing actual spend. |
| `playwright_create_timeout` | Playwright Suno driver | Live create polling timed out. | Check the Suno page/session and rerun only if the prior create did not consume credits. |
| `playwright_create_network_error` | Playwright Suno driver | Browser navigation or network transport failed. | Confirm local connectivity and Suno availability. |
| `playwright_create_dom_missing` | Playwright Suno driver | Expected Suno form or result selectors were missing. | Treat as UI drift; update selectors before live use. |
| `playwright_create_login_expired` | Playwright Suno driver | The persistent Suno session appears expired. | Run the manual Suno login flow in `docs/SUNO_BROWSER_DRIVER.md`. |
| `playwright_create_rate_limited` | Playwright Suno driver | Suno surfaced a rate-limit style failure. | Pause generation and wait for the platform limit to clear. |

## Gateway and auth boundary

| Code | Source | Meaning | Operator recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `account_not_created` | Frozen platform status | A platform lane is intentionally unavailable. | Keep the platform disabled until account setup is complete. |
| `gateway_token_mismatch` | Gateway boundary docs | The gateway/plugin access boundary rejected the caller or used stale credentials. | Recheck `docs/GATEWAY_AUTH.md` and restart the gateway with the intended local env. |
