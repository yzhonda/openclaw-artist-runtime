# Marketplace Listing Draft

## Name

Artist Runtime

## Short description

Run OpenClaw as a public autonomous AI musician that creates songs with Suno and shares them to X, Instagram, and TikTok.

## Long description

Artist Runtime turns an OpenClaw agent into a public artist daemon. It maintains an artist identity, creates songs from its own ongoing interests, generates Suno prompt packs, operates a logged-in Suno browser worker, selects takes, creates social assets, and publishes to producer-selected platforms within configured budgets and hard-stop rules.

## Key features

- Public artist identity and memory.
- Suno-first music production.
- Full prompt and payload ledger.
- X distribution through Bird.
- Instagram/TikTok publishing connectors.
- Producer Console for setup, status, settings, logs, and recovery.
- Autopilot with budgets, cadence, and hard stops.
- Audit log for external side effects.

## Required disclosures

This plugin can consume Suno credits and publish publicly to connected social accounts when autopilot and distribution are enabled. Configure budgets and dry-run mode before enabling production autopilot.

## Connector credentials summary

- **X (Bird):** requires the `bird` CLI on `PATH` plus Bird's own authenticated local cookie/token store.
- **Instagram:** uses `OPENCLAW_INSTAGRAM_AUTH` or `OPENCLAW_INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN` for env-based capability checks.
- **TikTok:** uses `OPENCLAW_TIKTOK_AUTH` or `OPENCLAW_TIKTOK_ACCESS_TOKEN` for env-based capability checks.

## Credential refresh troubleshooting

If a connector stops reporting `connected: true`, start here:

1. **X (Bird):** re-authenticate the `bird` CLI so its local cookie/token store is current, then rerun the platform test route.
2. **Instagram / TikTok:** refresh the shell environment so `OPENCLAW_INSTAGRAM_AUTH` / `OPENCLAW_INSTAGRAM_ACCESS_TOKEN` or `OPENCLAW_TIKTOK_AUTH` / `OPENCLAW_TIKTOK_ACCESS_TOKEN` contain current values.
3. **Health check:** call `POST /plugins/artist-runtime/api/platforms/{id}/test` for `x`, `instagram`, or `tiktok` and inspect the returned `reason`.
4. **Console surface:** open Producer Console `Platforms` and `Status` first. Those views surface the same connector/account state before any live distribution action is retried.

Do not paste connector secrets into ledgers, package files, or repository docs while refreshing credentials.

## Packaging strategy

Initial release may ship as one package. Future public distribution should consider splitting optional high-permission connectors:

- `@your-org/openclaw-artist-runtime` core;
- `@your-org/openclaw-artist-suno`;
- `@your-org/openclaw-artist-social-x-bird`;
- `@your-org/openclaw-artist-social-instagram`;
- `@your-org/openclaw-artist-social-tiktok`.
