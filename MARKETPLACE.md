# Marketplace Listing Draft

## Name

Artist Runtime

## Short description

Run OpenClaw as a public autonomous AI musician that creates songs with Suno and shares them to X, Instagram, and TikTok.

## Long description

Artist Runtime turns an OpenClaw agent into a public artist daemon. It maintains an artist identity, creates songs from its own ongoing interests, generates Suno prompt packs, operates a logged-in Suno browser worker, selects takes, creates social assets, and publishes to producer-selected platforms within configured budgets and hard-stop rules.

## Key features

- Public artist identity and memory.
- Suno-first music production.
- Full prompt and payload ledger.
- X distribution through Bird.
- Instagram/TikTok publishing connectors.
- Producer Console for setup, status, settings, logs, and recovery.
- Autopilot with budgets, cadence, and hard stops.
- Audit log for external side effects.

## Required disclosures

This plugin can consume Suno credits and publish publicly to connected social accounts when autopilot and distribution are enabled. Configure budgets and dry-run mode before enabling production autopilot.

## Suggested tags

music, suno, artist, social, x, instagram, tiktok, automation, creator-tools, public-agent

## Packaging strategy

Initial release may ship as one package. Future public distribution should consider splitting optional high-permission connectors:

- `@your-org/openclaw-artist-runtime` core;
- `@your-org/openclaw-artist-suno`;
- `@your-org/openclaw-artist-social-x-bird`;
- `@your-org/openclaw-artist-social-instagram`;
- `@your-org/openclaw-artist-social-tiktok`.
